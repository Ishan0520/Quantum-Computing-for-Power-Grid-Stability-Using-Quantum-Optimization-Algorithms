What?

Power grid stability is a critical aspect of modern energy management, ensuring a reliable and uninterrupted supply of electricity. As power demand fluctuates, maintaining grid balance requires real-time adjustments to generation, transmission, and distribution systems. This project leverages quantum optimization techniques to enhance power grid stability, beginning with an in-depth analysis of the key challenges, metrics, and data sources.
