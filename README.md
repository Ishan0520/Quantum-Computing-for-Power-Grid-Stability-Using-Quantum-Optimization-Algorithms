What?
Power grid stability is a critical aspect of modern energy management, ensuring a reliable and uninterrupted supply of electricity. As power demand fluctuates, maintaining grid balance requires real-time adjustments to generation, transmission, and distribution systems. This project leverages quantum optimization techniques to enhance power grid stability, beginning with an in-depth analysis of the key challenges, metrics, and data sources.
A power grid consists of three main components:
Generation: Power plants (coal, nuclear, hydro, solar, wind) produce electricity.
Transmission: High-voltage transmission lines transport electricity over long distances.
Distribution: Step-down transformers reduce voltage for local consumption.

Key Stability Challenges:
Voltage Fluctuations: Deviations from nominal voltage can lead to equipment failures.
Frequency Deviations: The grid must maintain 50/60 Hz to prevent power disruptions.
Peak Demand Variability: High demand periods stress grid infrastructure.
Renewable Energy Integration: Solar and wind energy introduce uncertainty in generation.
